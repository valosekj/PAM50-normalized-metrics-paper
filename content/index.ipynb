    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of spinal cord morphometry computed from magnetic resonance images serve as relevant prognostic biomarkers for a range of spinal cord pathologies, including traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative diseases. However, interpreting these imaging biomarkers is difficult due to considerable intra- and inter-subject variability. Yet, there is no clear consensus on a normalization method that would help reduce this variability and more insights into the distribution of these morphometrics are needed. In this study, we computed a database of normative values for six commonly used measures of spinal cord morphometry: cross-sectional area, anteroposterior diameter, transverse diameter, compression ratio, eccentricity, and solidity. Normative values were computed from a large open-access dataset of healthy adult volunteers (N = 203) and were brought to the common space of the PAM50 spinal cord template using a newly proposed normalization method based on linear interpolation. In comparison to traditional image-based registration, the proposed normalization approach does not involve image transformations and, therefore, does not introduce distortions of spinal cord anatomy. This is a crucial consideration in preserving the integrity of the spinal cord anatomy in conditions such as spinal cord injury. This new morphometric database allows researchers to normalize based on sex and age, thereby minimizing inter-subject variability associated with demographic and biological factors. The proposed methodology is open-source and accessible through the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT) v6.0 and higher."

    "# 1. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Spinal cord morphometry measures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The spinal cord plays a vital role in the central nervous system by transmitting sensory and motor signals between the brain and the rest of the body. It also contains essential networks responsible for functions such as locomotion and pain processing. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used to assess spinal cord macrostructure and to compute measures of spinal cord morphometry like cross-sectional area (CSA) or anteroposterior (AP) diameter. The morphometric measures serve as objective indicators to evaluate spinal cord pathologies, such as the extent of spinal cord atrophy in multiple sclerosis (Losseff et al., 1996; Mina et al., 2021; Rocca et al., 2019) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (El Mendili et al., 2023; Paquin et al., 2018) or the severity of spinal cord injury and spinal cord compression in traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injury, respectively (Badhiwala et al., 2020; David et al., 2019; Miyanji et al., 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, interpreting morphometric measures is challenging due to considerable inter-subject variability associated with demographic and biological factors. For example, significantly smaller CSA is consistently reported in females relative to males (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022; Engl et al., 2013; Mina et al., 2021; Papinutto et al., 2020, 2015; Rashid et al., 2006; Solstrand Dahlberg et al., 2020; Yanase et al., 2006). Similarly, studies showed an association of spinal cord CSA with cervical cord length (Martin et al., 2017a, 2017b; Oh et al., 2014), spinal canal area, and spinal canal diameters (Kesenheimer et al., 2021; Papinutto et al., 2020). Other factors, such as brain volume, intracranial volume, and thalamic volume also showed a strong correlation with spinal cord CSA (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022; Papinutto et al., 2020, 2015; Rashid et al., 2006; Solstrand Dahlberg et al., 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As for weight and height, studies showed only a moderate correlation with spinal cord CSA (Papinutto et al., 2020; Yanase et al., 2006) or did not show any significant association (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022; Papinutto et al., 2020; Solstrand Dahlberg et al., 2020). Likewise, only a weak non-significant association was reported between spinal cord CSA and age (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022; Kato et al., 2012; Papinutto et al., 2020; Yanase et al., 2006). A single study with a wide cohort age range reported that CSA increases until about 45 years of age and then begins to decrease (Papinutto et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to inter-subject variability, spinal cord anatomy varies depending on the level. Corresponding with anatomical textbooks (Standring, 2020), studies have shown an increase in CSA around levels C4-C5 corresponding to cervical enlargement (De Leener et al., 2018; Frostell et al., 2016; Horáková et al., 2022; Martin et al., 2017b; Mina et al., 2021; Rocca et al., 2019). Then, the spinal cord cross-section becomes smaller, which is mirrored by the decrease in CSA. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Normalization strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Various normalization strategies have been proposed to account for the above-mentioned factors on spinal cord morphometric measures. Sex was used for CSA normalization in several works (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022; Kesenheimer et al., 2021; Papinutto et al., 2020; Rashid et al., 2006). Other studies proposed spinal cord length as a normalization factor (El Mendili et al., 2023; Martin et al., 2017a, 2017b; Oh et al., 2014; Rocca et al., 2019). Additionally, combining spinal cord length with a z-score normalization was proposed to account for variations along the superior-inferior axis (Martin et al., 2017a, 2017b). Another approach taking into account the dependency of spinal cord anatomy on a level involved the normalization of morphometric measures from the compression site using non-compressed levels above and below (Guo et al., 2022; Miyanji et al., 2007). Finally, several studies normalized CSA using the spinal canal and brain metrics, including spinal canal area, spinal canal diameter, brain volume, intracranial volume, thalamic volume, and head size normalization factor (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022; Horsfield et al., 2010; Kesenheimer et al., 2021; Papinutto et al., 2020; Rashid et al., 2006; Rocca et al., 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While normalization strategies showed promising outcomes, there is currently no accepted consensus on which method to use (Cohen-Adad et al., 2021a; Papinutto et al., 2020), and their practical implementation may encounter several challenges. First, measuring the spinal cord length and the spinal canal area can be time-consuming due to the absence of reliable automatic measurement techniques. Second, obtaining brain MRI scans, necessary for assessing brain and thalamic volumes, may not be routinely available in spinal cord MRI protocols, and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis can influence brain measurements and potentially introduce bias during normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Spinal cord template\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to brain studies, spinal cord studies involving multiple subjects frequently rely on templates — standardized, high-resolution images of the human spinal cord used as a reference for comparing and analyzing individual spinal cord scans. A commonly used spinal cord template is the PAM50 (De Leener et al., 2018). The process of aligning individual single-subject images to the template typically involves a series of non-linear image transformations, which may introduce inaccuracies when computing morphometric measures in the PAM50 vs. in the native subject’s space. This is an important consideration, especially in subjects with altered spinal cord anatomy, such as patients with spinal cord injury. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Normative values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Several multi-subject studies have provided normative values for spinal cord morphometry (De Leener et al., 2018; Frostell et al., 2016; Horáková et al., 2022; Kato et al., 2012; Taso et al., 2016). However, these studies show inconsistency in their reporting. Some authors only provided values for intervertebral discs (De Leener et al., 2018; Horáková et al., 2022), while others presented values averaged across multiple vertebral levels (Taso et al., 2016). Notably, none of these studies have presented normative values separated by sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Study Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we present a database of healthy normative values for six commonly used measures of spinal cord morphometry built using a new fully-automatic normalization approach. The database is interactive, available online (<a href=\"https://preprint.neurolibre.org/10.55458/neurolibre.00016\">https://preprint.neurolibre.org/10.55458/neurolibre.00016/</a>) and allows filtering per sex, age, and MRI vendors. The proposed methodology is open-source, easily accessible through the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT) (De Leener et al., 2017), and can be used in future multi-subject studies to minimize inter- and intra-subject variability."

    "## 2.1 Participants\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Two hundred and three participants from the <i>spine-generic</i> dataset (multi-subject) were used (Cohen-Adad et al., 2021a). The dataset is open-access, organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard (Gorgolewski et al., 2016) and managed using git-annex (<a href=\"https://git-annex.branchable.com/\">https://git-annex.branchable.com/</a>) in the following GitHub repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/spine-generic/data-multi-subject/tree/r20230223\">https://github.com/spine-generic/data-multi-subject/tree/r20230223/</a>, release: r20230223.\n",

    "Participants were scanned across 43 centers on 3T MRI scanners from 3 vendors (Siemens, Philips, GE) using the consensus <i>spine-generic</i> acquisition protocol (Cohen-Adad et al., 2021b). For details on sequence parameters, see (Cohen-Adad et al., 2021a, 2021b).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Two experienced radiologists (MK, TR) evaluated MRI scans with a focus on the presence of spinal cord compression. Spinal cord compression was defined as a change in spinal cord contour at the level of an intervertebral disc on an axial or sagittal MRI plane compared with that at the midpoint level of neighbouring vertebrae (Kadanka et al., 2017; Keřkovský et al., 2017). Minor abnormalities such as mild disc protrusions, spine misalignment or minimal widening of the spinal cord central canal were not considered significant pathologies. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Data pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the T2-weighted images (0.8 mm isotropic resolution) covering at least C1 to T1 vertebral levels. The image processing was performed automatically using SCT v6.0 (De Leener et al., 2017). For each participant, the spinal cord was segmented using a deep learning-based algorithm (Gros et al., 2019) and the intervertebral discs were labeled (Ullmann et al., 2014) to generate the cord segmentation labeled with vertebral levels (Figure 1A).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The spinal cord segmentation and disc labels were visually inspected using SCT’s quality control report (<i>sct_qc</i> function) and manually corrected when necessary. The manual corrections ensured that the spinal cord segmentation masks used for the computation of morphometric measures were reliable. Segmentation masks were corrected using FSLeyes image viewer (<a href=\"https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes\">https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes</a>) by adding or removing voxels when appropriate. Regarding vertebral labeling corrections, we manually identified the posterior tip of the intervertebral discs using SCT’s <i>sct_label_utils</i> function when it was necessary.\n",

    "\n",
    "After the preprocessing (i.e., spinal cord segmentation and labeling), the morphometric measures were computed across individual axial slices from the spinal cord segmentation mask in the subject’s native space. Then, the number of axial slices corresponding to each vertebral level was identified in both the subject’s native space and in the PAM50 template based on the labeled segmentation. Finally, the computed morphometric measures were linearly interpolated to the PAM50 anatomical dimensions based on the number of slices for each vertebral level in the native space and the PAM50 template."

Eccentricity is defined as the ratio of the focal distance over the major axis length of an ellipse with the same second moments as the spinal cord. The value is in the interval [0, 1].

Solidity is used to measure the indentation of the spinal cord and is defined as the ratio of the area representing the spinal cord to the area of the smallest convex polygon surrounding all positive pixels in the image.

    "# 4. DISCUSSION\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This study introduced a framework to automatically normalize spinal cord morphometric measures and computed normative metrics from a public database of healthy adults. Normative values were reported in the reference space of the PAM50 spinal cord template, enabling easy comparison with other studies. The metrics were also presented in interactive figures, allowing convenient exploration and filtering based on sex, MRI vendors, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Participants\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessment of the <i>spine-generic</i> MRI scans by two experienced radiologists revealed mild spinal cord compression in 24% of volunteers. This finding aligns with previous studies that have reported the prevalence of asymptomatic spinal cord compression in up to 40% of the otherwise healthy population (Kovalova et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2021). Given our objective of constructing a database containing healthy normative morphometric values to minimize variability in future research, we excluded the subjects with mild compression to mitigate potential bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Normalization to PAM50 anatomical dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed normalization approach is performed per slice (not vertebral level) to avoid averaging within each vertebral level, as this could lead to a loss of information. This allows access to any specific range of slices in PAM50 space, which is beneficial, for example, in pathologies like spinal cord compression occurring at the intervertebral discs and spanning across several slices from adjacent levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to classical image-based registration, our normalization approach does not introduce geometrical image distortions, which may result in inaccuracies when computing morphometric measures. Traditional registration to the PAM50 template involves spinal cord straightening, vertebral alignment between the image and the template, and iterative slice-wise non-linear registration (De Leener et al., 2017). Each of these steps might change the spinal cord shape and contour (<a href=\"https://github.com/sct-pipeline/dcm-metric-normalization/issues/3\">https://github.com/sct-pipeline/dcm-metric-normalization/issues/3</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 Interactive figures and Normative database\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous studies (De Leener et al., 2018; Horáková et al., 2022; Kato et al., 2012; Taso et al., 2016) that presented normative values using \"static\" tables, our approach offers interactive figures that enable the visualization of normative values for any specific slice within the PAM50 space. Furthermore, previous studies, such as those conducted by (De Leener et al., 2018; Taso et al., 2016), focused on providing normative values solely for CSA and AP diameter (Kato et al., 2012), and only a recent study conducted by (Horáková et al., 2022) has encompassed normative values also for transverse diameter, compression ratio, solidity, and torsion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive figures presented in this study display normative values for all six metrics simultaneously, offering a convenient way to explore the relationship between individual morphometric measures. This may be particularly useful for assessing changes in spinal anatomy between levels or for identifying levels of spinal cord compression. Additionally, users have the option to show or hide traces by clicking on their corresponding legend items, allowing for easy exploration of trends related to sex, age decades, and MRI vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed open-source database of normative values in the PAM50 space allows for filtering subjects based on demographic and biological factors. Users can thus match sex, age, and MRI vendor with their study population and use our database for normalization of their cohort relative to the healthy population with respect to these factors. This is a relevant feature since normalization per sex is the most commonly used normalization factor for spinal cord morphometric measures (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022; Kesenheimer et al., 2021; Mina et al., 2021; Papinutto et al., 2020; Rashid et al., 2006; Rocca et al., 2019). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.4 Morphometric measures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSA values obtained in this study for individual intervertebral discs are in line with CSA measured in 50 healthy subjects (De Leener et al., 2018). For instance, we measured a CSA of 76.61 ± 8.35 mm<sup>2</sup> (mean ± standard deviation) for the C3-C4 intervertebral disc, while De Leener et al. obtained 77.46 ± 8.45 mm<sup>2</sup> for the same intervertebral disc (De Leener et al., 2018). In contrast, other studies reported either smaller or larger CSA for the same C3-C4 intervertebral disc. For example, Horáková et al. obtained a CSA of 71.7 ± 8.2 mm<sup>2</sup> (Horáková et al., 2022), while Kesenheimer et al. measured a CSA of 87.4 ± 8.31 mm<sup>2</sup> (Kesenheimer et al., 2021). This can be attributed to various factors, including differences in MRI contrast, variations in population ages, and variations in segmentation methods used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to CSA averaged from C2-C3 vertebral levels measured from the UK Biobank database (N = 804) of 66.4 ± 6.61 mm<sup>2</sup> (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022), we measured a larger CSA of 73.59 ± 7.41 mm<sup>2</sup> for C2 vertebral level and 74.32 ± 7.91 mm<sup>2</sup> for C3 vertebral level. This might be caused by the fact that we used T2-w images, whilst Bédard and Cohen-Adad used T1-w images (Bédard and Cohen-Adad 2022). It has been shown that T2-w scans generally provide larger CSA compared to T1-w scans (Cohen-Adad et al., 2021a).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As for AP diameter and transverse diameter, values measured in this study correspond with population estimates from Frostell et al. (2016). For instance, we measured an AP diameter of 7.86 ± 0.56 mm and a transverse diameter of 11.9 ± 0.76 mm for the C2 vertebral level, while Frostell et al. reported an AP diameter of 7.9 ± 1.6 mm and a transverse diameter of 12.3 ± 2.4 mm for the same vertebral level (Frostell et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirming previous studies (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022; Engl et al., 2013; Papinutto et al., 2020, 2015; Rashid et al., 2006; Solstrand Dahlberg et al., 2020; Yanase et al., 2006), we showed that females have smaller CSA relative to males across all vertebral levels. Smaller spinal cord size is also mirrored by lower AP and transverse diameters in females compared to males.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The increase in CSA around levels C4-C5 indicates the location of cervical enlargement, the source of the large spinal nerves that supply the upper limbs. This finding is consistent with anatomical textbooks (Standring, 2020) and previous studies (De Leener et al., 2018; Frostell et al., 2016; Horáková et al., 2022; Martin et al., 2017b; Mina et al., 2021; Rocca et al., 2019). After the cervical enlargement (i.e., below level C5), the spinal cord becomes smaller, which is mirrored by the decrease in CSA, AP diameter, and transverse diameter. The cranio-caudal decrease in AP diameter along the spinal cord, along with the changing trends in compression ratio and eccentricity, corresponds to the fact that the spinal cord is not cylindrical but rather changes its shape across levels from circular shape at C1 and C2 levels to a more elliptical shape around levels C5 and C6 (Standring, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because various morphometric measures exhibited differing levels of inter-subject variability (indicated by COV), we hypothesize that normalizing measures with greater inter-subject variability, such as CSA, would yield a more pronounced impact compared to normalizing measures with lower inter-subject variability, such as solidity. We measured a COV of 10.1% and 10.8% for the CSA at the C2 and C3 vertebral levels, respectively. These values are similar to the 9.96% COV reported by Bédard and Cohen-Adad for T1-w images at the C2-C3 level (Bédard and Cohen-Adad, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The variability of morphometric measures between MRI vendors might be explained by differences in sequence parameters and/or reconstruction filters between vendors (Cohen-Adad et al., 2021a). For this reason, our interactive database allows for filtering per MRI vendor."

    "## 4.5 Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the T2-w images from the open-access <i>spine-generic</i> dataset cover only the cervical spinal cord and have a relatively narrow age range (with 93.6% of subjects aged 21 to 40 years), it remains the largest open-source database of spinal cord MRI data. Incorporating additional subjects across different age groups and with data that encompasses the entire spinal cord will enhance future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are aware that the morphometric measures were derived solely from T2-w MRI contrast and using the segmentation method trained specifically for this contrast (Gros et al., 2019). This has to be considered when comparing with other MRI contrasts, such as T1-w, which showed a smaller CSA compared to T2-w (Cohen-Adad et al., 2021a). This might be mitigated in the future using a contrast-agnostic segmentation algorithm (Bédard, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Future efforts will focus on validating the proposed methods in pathologies such as traumatic and non-traumatic spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. This validation process will provide valuable insights into the applicability and accuracy of the methods in the context of various spinal cord conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.6 Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we introduced a new approach for the normalization of spinal cord morphometric measures to the PAM50 spinal cord template space to build an interactive database of normative values for six commonly used morphometric measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The database allows for the normalization of future datasets by considering factors such as sex, age, and MRI vendors. This functionality can be used to facilitate multi-subject studies and help minimize variability associated with demographic and biological factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed methodology, as well as all results, were made open-source and easily accessible through the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT) v6.0  and higher, enabling easy use by other researchers."
